Ralph is what we like to call “awesomely autistic,” and we are so very proud to be a happily neurodiverse family! We simply felt that it would be amazing if we could find a dog that could assist Ralph with things like being more active outdoors making new friends, practicing his socialization skills, providing an anchor in order to avoid episodes of autistic eloping, and finding comfort during autistic meltdowns when overstimulated.\",\n  url: \"https://www.petcofoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Koppelman_peopleschoice-210x170.jpg\"\n}, {\n  id: 2,\n  title: \"Adopted Dog Finds her Soulmates\",\n  story: \"When I walked in the shelter and saw Luna in a tiny crate, just lying there sleeping while her litter mate bounced up and down and gained the attention of everyone, I had a gut feeling I would be taking that puppy home.

Students at my university used to take trips to Greenville Humane Society as study breaks and on a random Monday in November 2016, I decided to as well. When I got to the shelter it was filled with orange cats — a rarity that I was super excited about. My mom is allergic to cats so I was never able to have one growing up, but I had always wanted an orange cat. I even have a photo of me as a 4-year-old with my aunt’s cat that I picked out from the shelter! I loved on a few cats that day, but then went back to school — because how impulsive would it be to get a cat, right? On the car ride home I thought to myself, “I bet Egg Nog would be a good name for an orange cat,” which is exactly what I told my roommate when I got home. Her reaction was nothing like I thought it would be: “Caroline! You should adopt a kitten.” Impulsive, right? We got in the car, picked up our third roommate, drove to the Humane Society, pet every orange cat in the room, and finally landed on the one that would be my Egg Nog. I’m 24 now and I’m the cat lady amongst all my dog-loving friends, but I’m proud to be that; just like I’m proud to be Egg Nog’s mom. My cat saved me from myself and quite literally is the reason I wake up every day (5 a.m. breakfast call, anyone?). I thank the Greenville Humane Society every day for the work they do in our community and for their ability to match people with their very best friends. Thank you. Each year, the Petco Foundation invites adopters to share the story of how their adopted pet changed their lives during the annual Holiday Wishes campaign, giving the organization that they adopted from a chance to receive a grant award. This story by Caroline won Greenville Humane Society in Greenville, South Carolina a 2019 Holiday Wishes award.\",\n  url:
